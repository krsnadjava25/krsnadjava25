### Hi! Hello! Hola! Hai! Salute! 안녕! 

# My name is Krisna Fathurahman

I am a fullstack developer from Bandung, Indonesia 🇮🇩. Interested on web technology but sometimes working on mobile app technology as well if needed.
Currently active as Google Developer Group Cloud Bandung community organizer.

Right now, i'm focusing on build my own IT startup in Bandung. If you are curious about it, let's have a coffee together.

### Tools & technologies that I maintained right now:
* Web Javascript Frameworks (React, Preact, Vue, NextJS, NuxtJS)
* NodeJS Applications (mostly built on top of Express)
* Typescript!!!
* Hybrid Mobile Applications (React Native, Flutter)
* PHP Web Framework (Laravel)
* DevOps related (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform)

### Fun facts about me:
* I love foods, so I love cooks 🍳
* A sip of coffee :coffee:  in the morning and tea :tea:  in the evening
* Spending weekends mostly on Netflix series, korean drama, and anime
* I want to travel a lot, like a lot
* I can call myself Indonesian local language polyglot

### My motto in life:

> "Nowadays, there are many talented people. To make yourself prominent than the others:
(1) just be yourself, (2) respect and help other, (3) have faith and integrity, and lastly (4) stay foolish and hungry."
